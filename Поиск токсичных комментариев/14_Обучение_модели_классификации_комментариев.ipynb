        "- Наилучший результат на тестовом датасете показала модель- CatBoostClassifier - 0.77\n",
        "- Основной прирост к метрике дала именно перебор гиперпарматров, в то время как использование различных подходов к векторизации, не показал значительных результатов в рамках данного датасета, однако это также могло быть связано с использванием не самых оптимальных алгоритмов векторизации, что определенно стоит изучить в будущем\n",
        "- Что интересно, из-за большого датасета, перебор гиперпараметров на полном датасете был слишком время затратен, в связи с чем, я проводил перебор гиперпараметров только на 5000 строках датасета, после чего проводил обучение лучшей модели на полном датасете и предсказание на тестовой выборке. Что позволило мне получить мне в итоге оптимальный необходимый по условиям задачи результат, с учетом ограниченных мощностей"
